# Neural Network Project for Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

## Introduction

This project focuses on applying neural networks to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The primary goal is to develop a neural network model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various medical and demographic features.

## Project Overview

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset contains information about various health metrics of female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset is widely used in the field of machine learning for binary classification tasks. This project aims to build a neural network model using this dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is part of the `mlbench` package in R. It consists of 768 samples and 8 features. The features include:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

The target variable is `diabetes`, indicating whether a patient has diabetes (positive) or not (negative).
